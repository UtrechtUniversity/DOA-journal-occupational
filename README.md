## How to use 

This is a [Quarto website project]. The suggested procedure to use this repository and contribute is through RStudio. Please start by making sure that R and RStudio are installed in your computer:
1. Install [R and RStudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/) on your computer if you haven't done so.
2. [Clone this repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository). If you do not know how to do this, [you can follow these instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/overview/getting-started-with-github-desktop). Alternatively, you can [download the ZIP file](https://github.com/UtrechtUniversity/DOA-journal-occupational/archive/refs/heads/main.zip), unpack it, and place it in a folder in your computer.
3. You should now have all these files in your computer with an identical folder structure (described in the following section).
4. In the main directory, open the file named ***DOA-journal-occupational.Rproj*** in RStudio.
5. You can navigate through the folders on the right-bottom panel of R Studio. You should now see a series of files ending with ***.qmd***, where you can edit the content to be displayed in the website.
6. The ***index.qmd*** file contains most of the current project ideas to which you may contribute. 
7. To see how the current tab would look like in a website, click the Render button in RStudio. This will generate an html file, which you will be able to locate in the ***_index.qmd_site*** folder. You can open this file locally.
