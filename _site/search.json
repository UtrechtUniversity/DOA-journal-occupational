This means that authors can submit protocols, commentaries, tutorials, datasets, softwares, among others.\nThe journal will publish the following types of content:\n\nResearch articles: Original research articles that present new findings in the field of occupational health. These articles will be peer-reviewed by experts in the field.\nReview articles: Comprehensive reviews of current topics in occupational health, including systematic reviews and meta-analyses.\nNarrative reviews: Articles that provide a narrative overview of a specific topic in occupational health, without the need for a systematic review.\nProtocols: Detailed descriptions of research protocols for scientific studies in occupational health, protocols that improve practice within industry, or public health recommendations.\nMethods: Articles that study or describe research methods or applications in practice.\nComputational Tutorials: Step-by-step instructions on how to perform specific techniques and/or analyses, with emphasis in open science practices.\nDataset: Description of a dataset with the potential to be reused by other practitioners and researchers in the occupational health field. The referred dataset should be deposited in a public repository (i.e., Harvard Dataverse, Figshare).\nSoftware: Description of software tools or applications that can be used by practitioners and researchers in the occupational health field.\nCase studies: Reports of unique cases or experiences in the field of occupational health.\nCommentaries: Opinion pieces, perspectives, debates, journal clubs on current issues in occupational health.\nEditorial: Editorial content from the journal’s editorial board, including updates on the journal’s policies and practices."

To make this possible, we work with a diamond open access publication model, making content available to the research community at no cost to researchers nor readers. The journal embraces open science practices, so we operate with (optional) open peer-review. Data and code can be submitted as independent research outputs to accompany research papers published in the journal. We welcome submissions from all fronts aiming to improve occupational health to build links between academic and non-academic contexts of practice."

This includes papers addressing but not limited to: exposure at the workplace to chemical, physical, biological, ergonomic, psychosocial, among others; health outcomes (acute, chronic, accidents), interventions at the workplace, prevention, decision making, and aspects related to the practice of occupational hygiene and medicine from their many different areas. There is also special interest in the publication of classical and novel (computational) methods in the form of full-length papers, descriptions of new computational packages (R, python, etc.), or tutorials. The journal encourages authors to accompany their submissions with any underlying data and code for reproducibility whenever possible (i.e., GitHub repository, dataverse, zenodo, etc.). These can also be submitted as individual items for simultaneous publication in the journal.\nNovel topics within the field (just to mention how novelty can be addressed with examples)\n\nOccupational exposome – the ‘Worksome’; occupation-course epidemiology (instead of life-course epidemiology)\nGeospatial analysis in occupational epidemiology (ex. air pollutants, surface temperature, built-up environment, etc.)\nClimate change and workers (ex. methodological needs?)/ Occupational global health/ and occupational infectious diseases in non-healthcare workers"

This will grant early access to the manuscript"
