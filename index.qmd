This is a project proposal for a diamond open access (DOA) journal in occupational health, with a focus on the publication of research and educational content, as well as experiences from young researchers in the field. As an academic and community-led journal, content will be published online-only, at no cost to authors and readers, whilst allowing authors to retain copyright of their work.
